# Flutter UI challenge
This repository contains a very simple project in the sense that it does not perform any actions per se. The main point of this was to get to know the different available widgets and how they can be used/modified. The end goal can be seen here -> https://dribbble.com/shots/14139155-Point-of-Sale-System-Design/attachments/5763503?mode=media
